### import requests 
This line imports the requests library for making HTTP requests to interact with web services and APIs.

### import json
This line imports the json module, which provides functions to encode and decode JSON data

### URL = "http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/uvks-tn5n.json"
This line defines a variable named URL and assigns it the value of the API endpoint URL.

### response = requests.get(URL)
This line sends an HTTP GET request to the URL specified in the URL variable using the requests.get() method. The response from the API is stored in the response variable.

### json_content = json.loads(response.text)
This line converts the JSON response from the API (which is stored in response.text) into a Python data structure. The json.loads() function is used to parse the JSON text, and the resulting Python data is stored in the json_content variable.

### print(json.dumps(json_content, indent=4))
This line prints the JSON data obtained from the API in a more human-readable format. It uses json.dumps() to serialize the Python data back into a JSON-formatted string, with an indentation of 4 spaces for better readability. The result is then printed to the console.
